Follow on-screen instructions
Enjoy!

Try out the stuff in the Mods folder, the Sounds and Splash screen at least are easy to apply

RECOMMENDED ADDONS:

Install from Start > Extras (Add-ons) - Repo

Shoutcast Media Source - for the internet radio option
Demo PVR Client / Simple IPTV - for the TV part
